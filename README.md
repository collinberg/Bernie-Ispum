# Bernie Ipsum - Lorem Generator
This is a basic Lorem Ipsum generator created in the fashion of Bernie Sanders. The generator gives the user the choice to generate one to five headers, sentances or paragraphs. I compiled the terms for this generator by using word clouds generated from speachs and the copy of issues that he presented on his website.

## Technical Aspects
I created this generator to get a better understand of how both Javascript and jQuery in general. jQuery is used to update the number while the user uses the slider and create variables based of DOM elements. Javasript is then used to generate a random number that is used to determine the output of an array that holds all the possible phrases.

The site is also combiled using Sass.
